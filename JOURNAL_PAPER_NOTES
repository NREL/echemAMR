1) Figures 6,7 and 8 can be obtained by running python codes and 
gnuplot scripts in BVTester/Py_version
  a. Figure 6 in BVTester/Py_version/electrode_electrolyte
  b. Figure 7 in BVTester/Py_version/electrode_electrolyte_electrode
  c. Figure 8 in BVTester/Py_version/electrode_electrolyte by varying 
  the activation function in code trode_lyte.py

2) Figures 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 can be obtained by running C++ codes and 
   py scripts in regression_tests 
   a. Figure 9 in regression_tests/OCE_2d with exactcompare.py script as well as the 
      gnuplot script
   b. Figure 10 in regression_tests/CEA_2d with py and gnuplot scripts
   c. Figuer 11,12, and 13 are from regression_tests/CEAcharging_2d

3) Figure 14 and 15 are from models/CathodeElectrolyteDischarge/. Note that 
the GPU runs will need compilation for specific architecture and need the 
required hardware (NVIDIA/AMD). 

4) Figure 16 and 17 are for a large microstructure case. A similar one can be 
run using models/MicroStructure/inputs_SphereSphere_Contact
